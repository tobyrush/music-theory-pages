Music Theory for Musicians and Normal People
by Toby W. Rush

This is collection of educational music theory resources originally released under a CC-BY-NC-ND license, which I am now making available under a CC-BY-NC 4.0 license, allowing others to use, edit, and adapt freely.

These documents were originally written in American English, and are located in the /en-us/ directory. Each file is available in three different formats:

- Adobe Illustrator (.ai)
- Portable Document Format (.pdf)
- Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg)

**Fonts**

PDF files contain subsets of the required fonts embedded into the document. Because many of the fonts are not available under a Creative Commons license, they are not included in this package; to open or edit the Illustrator or SVG files, you must procure the necessary fonts, or replace them with other fonts.

In the American English pages, most comic lettering is set in BlamBot’s Smack Attack and Smack Attack Bold, page titles are in Microsoft’s Haettenschweiler, and additional text on Sparky’s pages are in set in BlamBot’s BadaBoom. Staff notation makes use of MakeMusic’s Maestro notation font.

Because the free version of Smack Attack does not include accented characters, many of the non-English. pages use BlamBot’s Might Makes Right for lettering.

**Translations**

Many of these pages have been translated into other languages, thanks to the efforts of wonderful volunteers over the past decade. Translated versions, which range from a few pages to near-complete sets, are organized into folders by language code:

- CY - Welsh
- DE - German
- EN-UK - English (British/Australian localisation)
- ES-ES - Spanish
- ES-MX - Mexican Spanish
- EU - Basque
- FR - French
- GL - Galician
- IT - Italian
- PT-BR - Brazilian Portuguese
- PT-PT - Portuguese
- RU - Russian
- VI - Vietnamese
- ZH - Simplified Chinese

My hope is that releasing these files under a more open license will facilitate the continued development of these translations and the addition others.
